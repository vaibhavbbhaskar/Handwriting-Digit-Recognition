# Handwritten Digits Recognition with Logistic Regression

This project involves the construction of a Logistic Regression model to recognize handwritten digits. The model uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. After acquiring and visualizing the dataset, it is split into training and test subsets. The model is then trained, evaluated, and used for prediction. The final step includes visualization and interpretation of a confusion matrix to better understand the model's performance.

## Technologies and Packages Used:
**Language:** Python<br> 
**Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Numpy<br>
**Machine Learning Algorithm:** Logistic Regression<br>
**Data:** MNIST Dataset (from OpenML)<br>
**Data Handling:** fetch_openml (for data acquisition), train_test_split (for data partitioning)<br>
**Visualization:** Matplotlib (for image and confusion matrix visualization)<br>
**Performance Evaluation:** Confusion Matrix<br>
