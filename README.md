# Handwritten Digits Recognition with Logistic Regression

This project is a beginner-friendly Python and Machine Learning application focused on building a logistic regression model to analyze and recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. We will read over 70,000 input samples, visualize and analyze each digit, create our testing and training datasets, fit the logistic regression model, and visualize the accuracy of our predictions with a confusion matrix!

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:



You can install these packages via pip:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn sklearn
```
